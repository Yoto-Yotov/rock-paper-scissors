The classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game with an extra that you can add a new hand ("water" for example) and you can choose what hands it wins against. 
You have to choose the number of round you want to play first. The both players hands are chosen at random and a winner is declared. If they are even the round is replayed until a player wins.
